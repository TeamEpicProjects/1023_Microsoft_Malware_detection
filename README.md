# Microsoft_Malwrae_detection

## Problem Statement
The malware industry continues to be a well-organized, well-funded market dedicated to evading traditional security measures. Once a computer is infected by malware, criminals can hurt consumers and enterprises in many ways.
With more than one billion enterprise and consumer customers, Microsoft takes this problem very seriously and is deeply invested in improving security.
As one part of their overall strategy for doing so, Microsoft is challenging the data science community to develop techniques to predict if a machine will soon be hit with malware. Microsoft is providing with an unprecedented malware dataset to encourage open-source progress on effective techniques for predicting malware occurrences.

Here we are trying to get into the data and try to develop different machine learning model for identifying weather the file is malicious or not.

## User Stories/ Key Achievements
1.	Understanding the dataset and know the proper approach in case of dirty, missing, unbalanced data.
2.	Importance of feature engineering with regard to latency, interpretability, computation keeping accuracy as focus.
3.	Training the model with regard to base line model to improve the evaluation score on validation dataset.
4.	Introduction of deep learning models
5.	Preparing the final document.


## Expected Solution
Solution will focus on developing a decision system that is based on AI- machine learning based system, capable of classifying file as malicious or not based on the file description and other metadata associated with the file.
